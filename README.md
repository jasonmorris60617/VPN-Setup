# VPN-Setup
How I would implement a VPN 

Setting up NordVPN on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is an essential process for ensuring a secure and private environment for clients. To begin, I would provision the Azure VM using the Azure portal or Azure CLI. During this step, I would select the appropriate operating system based on the client's needs, such as Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) or Windows. I would then configure the VM size, network settings, and storage options. To enable remote access, I would ensure that the security group settings allow inbound traffic for SSH (for Linux VMs) or RDP (for Windows VMs).

Once the VM is up and running, I would proceed with setting up NordVPN. For Linux-based VMs, I would connect to the VM using SSH and update the system to ensure it has the latest software and security patches. Next, I would download and install the NordVPN setup package from the official NordVPN website. After the installation, I would log in using the NordVPN command-line tool and connect to a server. This could be the fastest server available or a specific location, depending on the client's needs. I would then verify the VPN connection status and configure features such as auto-connect to ensure that the VPN reconnects automatically upon reboot. Additionally, I would enable the NordVPN killswitch to prevent any traffic from bypassing the VPN in case the connection drops.

For Windows-based VMs, I would connect to the VM using RDP and download the NordVPN application directly from the official website. I would install the application by following the on-screen instructions, log in to the client, and connect to a server. Just like in the Linux setup, I would configure auto-connect to ensure the VPN remains active even after a system restart. To verify the connection, I would use an online tool, such as "What is my IP Address," to confirm that the public IP address corresponds to the NordVPN server, or alternatively, use cmdlets.

To enhance the security and functionality of the setup, I would configure additional features. For example, enabling DNS leak protection would ensure that all traffic is securely routed through NordVPN's DNS servers. If the client has specific needs, I could configure split tunneling to allow certain applications or services to bypass the VPN connection. On Linux, I could also use iptables or NordVPN's built-in settings to fine-tune firewall rules and ensure that traffic is securely routed.

After completing the setup, I would document the entire process for the client. This documentation would include detailed instructions on how to manage and maintain the NordVPN setup, as well as steps to troubleshoot common issues. For added convenience, I would automate the connection process using scripts. On Linux, a shell script could be written to handle VPN connections automatically, while on Windows, a PowerShell script could simplify the configuration of the NordVPN client.

By following this structured approach, I would ensure that the Azure VM is securely connected to NordVPN. This setup would provide the client with a reliable, private, and easily manageable network environment tailored to their specific needs.
